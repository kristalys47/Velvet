To run the program:
1. Open a terminal in the project root folder (Velvet)
2. Run: npm install
3. Run: node velvet.js

velvet.js contains the code to be tested, which will take ResumeTestingPath.html and modify the content of the elements with id 'fullName', 'jobTitle' and 'headshotImage' to the specified values. It then takes the modified html and creates a pdf file from it called 'example.pdf'

The Velvet code is specified in the file UserCode.velvet located in the root folder. 
This is where the user can input the desired code.
